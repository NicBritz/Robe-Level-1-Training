            Some AT series and those before used mainly transformer power supplies,
            magnetic ballasts and dual-in-line PIC (Programmable Integrated Circuit)
            processors and very basic feature control. However, their simplicity was
            the reason for their success and Robe products gained a good reputation for
            reliability.

            With the market demanding more in the way of sophistication, Robe responded
            to this by drawing together advances in switch mode power supplies,
            microprocessors and reduction in the costs of touchscreen technology to create
            the ROBIN<sup>®</sup> Series.

            Robe was one of the first manufacturers to incorporate RDM almost from its inception.
            (All of the above terms will be explained!) But more importantly, Robe introduced technology
            of their own to make the fixtures brighter, lighter and more versatile. Their design philosophy
            is summed up in three words;
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">Smaller, Lighter, Brighter</p>
