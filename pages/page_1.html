<h2>About this handbook</h2>
<p>
    This handbook is intended to accompany the practical 2–3 day course on Robe ROBIN® fixtures, but also to be a useful reference in itself.
</p>
<p>
    The book and course are intended for shop technicians, production technicians and others who may be new to Robe or not fully familiar with the brand.</p>
<p>
    It uses particular examples from specific fixtures in the ROBIN® range but represents the whole range in terms of hardware, features and control.
    It also contains links to You Tube, parts of the Robe website and internet articles which are relevant to each chapter.
</p>
