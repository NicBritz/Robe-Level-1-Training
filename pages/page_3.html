            The Robin 800W discharge fixtures have output comparable to some
            of the 1200W fixtures currently on the market, but with much less size
            and weight, and the Robe LED fixtures are market leaders.

        <p>The name <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>ROBIN</strong></span><sup>®</sup>,
            is an acronym which stands for <span style="font-size: 16px"><strong>ROB</strong></span>e <span style="font-size: 16px"><strong>IN</strong></span>novation.</p>
        <p>
            In this handbook we will be looking at this in terms of the control capability, i.e. <em>DMX, Wireless DMX, Ethernet (Artnet and MAnet),
            Streaming ACN (sACN) and RDM</em>.</p>
        <p> The Arc and LED sources will also be explained in appropriate detail.</p>

        <h2>The second-generation Robe Navigation System (RNS 2)</h2>
        <p>This is the menu system used on the ROBIN® series.</p>
        <p> XT series and those before used 7 segment displays and buttons to access menu items.</p>
        <p>
            AT series introduced the Robe Navigation System (RNS), using a graphic display and encoder wheel to highlight and select menu items.
            This allowed easy access to a wider selection of parameters, and was groundbreaking in its time as even the market-leading brands were
            still using 7 segment displays.</p>
        <p>
            The ROBIN® series utilizes touchscreen technology using an intelligent display, which provides a complete user interface to the feature
            range of these fixtures. With so many possibilities, the menu system on all ROBIN® fixtures is separated into logical sections called Tabs.
            The CycFX, MiniMe, Mini Pointe and LEDbeam100 use a small LCD display accessed by four buttons, but the category headings within the menu
            system are similar. The example below is from a discharge fixture, the MMX.
